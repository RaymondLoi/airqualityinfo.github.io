    <h3>What is Air Quality Index (AQI)?</h3>
    <p>
        Air Quality Index (AQI) is the Environmental Protection Agency's measurment for how polluted the air is.
        <br>
        Air Quality Index ranges from 0 to 500. 0 being the pollution and 500 being the most pollution.
        <br>
        Both the American Lung Association and AirNow list AQI between 0 to 50 as satisfactory air quality.

    <h3>What is Particulate Matter?</h3>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.who.int/teams/environment-climate-change-and-health/air-quality-and-health/health-impacts/types-of-pollutants" target="_blank">World Health Organization</a>
        defines particulate matter as "inhalable particles, composed of sulphate, nitrates, ammonia, sodium chloride,
        black carbon, mineral dust or water.". Often times particulate matter is used as  measurement of air quality. Breathing
        in pariculate matter can lead to long term health problems such as lung cancer.

    <h3>Why is Air Quality Important?</h3>
    <p>
        According to a WHO article: "Air pollution is responsible for 6.7 million premature deaths every year". Those
        deaths are a result of household air pollution and ambient air pollution. Poor quality air leads to illness and death.
        We must work to towards a world where people can enjoy good quality air. In the meantime, we must be aware when air
        quality is poor in our local area and take protection measures and actions for our health and safety.
